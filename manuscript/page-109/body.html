Fancy treating Gus as if he were the gardener!"</p><p>Mrs. Trenor brought this out in a CRESCENDO of indignation.</p><p>"Oh, well, perhaps Lady Cressida will reconcile the Wetheralls to meeting Carry Fisher," said Miss Bart pacifically.</p><p>"I'm sure I hope so!

The worst of it is that she would have been so useful at the right time. You know we have to have the Bishop once a year, and she would have given just the right tone to things. I always have horrid luck about the Bishop's visits," added Mrs. Trenor, whose present misery was being fed by a rapidly rising tide of reminiscence; "last year, when he came, Gus forgot all about his being here, and brought home the Ned Wintons and the Farleysâ€”five divorces and six sets of children between them!"</p></div> </div>
