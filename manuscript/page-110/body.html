I was in such a hurry to get her away from Maria that I actually forgot to name a date, and Gus says she told some one she meant to stop here all winter."</p><p>"To stop here? In this house?"</p><p>"Don't be silly—in America. But if no one else asks her—you know they NEVER go to hotels."</p><p>"Perhaps Gus only said it to frighten you."</p><p>"No—I heard her tell Bertha Dorset that she had six months to put in while her husband was taking the cure in the Engadine. You should have seen Bertha look vacant! But it's no joke, you know—if she stays here all the autumn she'll spoil everything, and Maria Van Osburgh will simply exult."</p><p>At this affecting vision Mrs. Trenor's voice trembled with self-pity.</p></div> </div>
